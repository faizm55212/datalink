# Assetto Corsa EVO — Shared Memory Reference

> A field-by-field reference for the three named shared-memory blocks
> Assetto Corsa EVO publishes on Windows. Intended as a long-lived study
> document — every field this overlay reads, every field still opaque,
> and every quirk worth knowing about future struct extensions.

This document is a consolidated transcription of the publicly available
information about AC EVO's shared-memory layout, cross-referenced with
the live-telemetry overlay's own ctypes structs in
[`src/live_telemetry_evo/sources/ac_evo.py`](../src/live_telemetry_evo/sources/ac_evo.py).

The canonical upstream source is Kunos's official guide on Steam:
**[Assetto Corsa EVO — Shared Memory documentation (#3707421508)](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3707421508).**
Where this document and the Steam guide disagree, the guide wins — file
an issue or PR so the overlay catches up.

## 1. Transport

AC EVO publishes telemetry through three Windows named file-mappings under
the `Local\` namespace:

| Tag                            | Cadence              | Purpose                                |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `Local\acevo_pmf_physics`      | Every physics step (typically 333 Hz) | Fast-changing dynamics — pedals, RPM, wheels, forces |
| `Local\acevo_pmf_graphics`     | Every rendered frame (HUD-rate)       | Slower HUD/UI data — laps, fuel, position, electronics |
| `Local\acevo_pmf_static`       | Once per session                       | Track / session metadata that won't change mid-session |

**Important:** Python's stdlib `mmap.mmap(-1, size, tagname=name)` will
*create* a mapping under the requested name if one doesn't exist. That
is the wrong behaviour for "did the game start yet?": you'd silently
attach to an empty mapping and read zeros. Use Win32
`OpenFileMappingW` directly — it returns `NULL` (with
`ERROR_FILE_NOT_FOUND == 2`) when the name does not exist. See
[`_NamedMapping`](../src/live_telemetry_evo/sources/ac_evo.py) for the canonical
read-only attach.

The `Local\` prefix is mandatory in the API call. Some references show
the bare names (`acevo_pmf_*`); both work because Windows resolves bare
names to the per-session `Local\` namespace, but the explicit form is
unambiguous and matches what AC EVO publishes.

**Endianness.** Little-endian on all supported platforms (Windows
x86-64). All multi-byte integers and floats follow the host
representation.

**Concurrency.** AC EVO writes the blocks without any documented
producer/consumer synchronisation. Readers should:

* tolerate torn reads — verify `packetId` jumps by at most one between
  consecutive reads when ordering matters;
* never assume a sub-struct is consistent across reads if the producer
  is mid-write — the overlay re-reads the full block per tick rather
  than per field.

---

## 2. Block sizes & versions

| Block      | Documented size | Overlay map size† |
| ---------- | --------------- | ----------------- |
| `physics`  | 800 bytes       | 4096 bytes        |
| `graphics` | ~6–8 kB (varies — embeds 60-car coord table) | 8192 bytes |
| `static`   | ~210 bytes      | 2048 bytes        |

† *The overlay maps a generously-sized region. Mapping more than the
producer wrote is harmless on Windows (the trailing pages are
zero-filled), and it means the reader doesn't have to know the exact
byte size up-front.*

The static block carries two version strings:

* `sm_version` — shared-memory format version (e.g. `"1.0"`, `"1.1"`).
  Bump when offsets change.
* `ac_evo_version` — game build version. Useful for matching dumps
  against game patches.

Always log both at session start when investigating a layout discrepancy.

---

## 3. Conventions used in every block

* **Wheel ordering.** Every per-wheel array is ordered
  `[FL, FR, RL, RR]`. Both AC1 and AC EVO agree on this.
* **Gear convention.** `0 = Reverse`, `1 = Neutral`, `2..N = forward
  gears`. Display gear = `gear − 1` for forward gears.
* **Pedal scale.** Physics-block pedals (`gas`, `brake`, `clutch`) are
  `0.0..1.0`. Graphics-block `*_percent` mirrors of the same values are
  also `0.0..1.0` (despite the `_percent` suffix — the names come from
  AC1).
* **Steering scale.** `physics.steerAngle` is in **radians**, signed
  (negative = left). The graphics block exposes a `steer_degrees` int
  for HUD use.
* **Angles.** Pitch / roll / heading / camber are in **radians**.
* **Forces & torques.** Newtons (`fx`, `fy`, `wheelLoad`) and
  Newton-metres (`mz`, `brakeTorque`).
* **Temperatures.** °C unless suffixed otherwise.
* **Pressures.** psi for tyres (`wheelsPressure`,
  `tyre_pressure`); bar for fluids (`oil_pressure_bar`,
  `water_pressure_bar`, `fuel_pressure_bar`).
* **Distance.** Track length in metres; lap distance in kilometres
  (`current_km`, `total_km`); ride heights in **metres or millimetres
  depending on the chassis** — the overlay auto-detects (any value with
  `|height| ≥ 1.0` is treated as mm; below that it's metres × 1000).
* **Boolean encoding.** Booleans are 1-byte `c_bool` in the graphics &
  static blocks; the physics block uses `c_int32` flags
  (`pitLimiterOn`, `tcInAction`, `absInAction`, `drsAvailable`,
  `drsEnabled`, `ignitionOn`, `starterEngineOn`, `isEngineRunning`,
  `isAIControlled`).
* **String encoding.** Most strings are fixed-length `char[33]`
  null-padded ASCII. Decode by stripping trailing `\x00` then ASCII
  decode (`bytes(...).rstrip(b'\x00').decode('ascii', errors='ignore')`).
  The version strings in the static block are `char[15]`.
* **Struct packing.** All structs are `_pack_ = 4`. ctypes preserves
  natural alignment within that bound — i.e. `int32`/`float` align on
  4, but `char[33]` does not, and `c_bool` is 1 byte. This means the
  graphics and static blocks have implicit padding before any 4-byte
  field that follows a `char[N]` whose `N` is not a multiple of 4.

---

## 4. Physics block — `Local\acevo_pmf_physics`

Total documented size: **800 bytes**. The first 416 bytes are
AC1-compatible (so AC1 plugins that only read up to `tyreTempO` continue
to work); the remaining 384 bytes are AC EVO additions.

Offsets below are computed from `_pack_ = 4` natural alignment of
`int32`/`float`/`int32[N]`/`float[N]` fields — the layout is regular
because there are no `char[N]` or `bool` fields in this block.

### 4.1 AC1-compatible prefix (offsets 0–415)

| Offset | Size | Type        | Field                  | Units / Range            | Notes |
| -----: | ---: | ----------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------ | ----- |
|      0 |    4 | `int32`     | `packetId`             | monotonically increasing | Sequence number — useful for change-detection and torn-read guards. |
|      4 |    4 | `float`     | `gas`                  | 0..1                     | Throttle pedal. |
|      8 |    4 | `float`     | `brake`                | 0..1                     | Brake pedal. |
|     12 |    4 | `float`     | `fuel`                 | litres                   | **Deprecated mirror** — graphics `fuel_liter_current_quantity` is the current source. |
|     16 |    4 | `int32`     | `gear`                 | 0=R, 1=N, 2..N=forward   | See gear convention. |
|     20 |    4 | `int32`     | `rpms`                 | RPM                      | Live engine speed. |
|     24 |    4 | `float`     | `steerAngle`           | rad, signed              | Negative = left. |
|     28 |    4 | `float`     | `speedKmh`             | km/h                     | Ground speed. |
|     32 |   12 | `float[3]`  | `velocity`             | m/s, world XYZ           | World-frame velocity. |
|     44 |   12 | `float[3]`  | `accG`                 | g (≈9.81 m/s²)           | `[0]=lateral, [1]=vertical, [2]=longitudinal`. **Note ordering** — graphics `g_forces_x/y/z` exposes the same triple. |
|     56 |   16 | `float[4]`  | `wheelSlip`            | per-wheel                | Combined slip metric. |
|     72 |   16 | `float[4]`  | `wheelLoad`            | N                        | Vertical load per corner. |
|     88 |   16 | `float[4]`  | `wheelsPressure`       | psi                      | Inflation pressure. |
|    104 |   16 | `float[4]`  | `wheelAngularSpeed`    | rad/s                    | Per-wheel angular speed. |
|    120 |   16 | `float[4]`  | `tyreWear`             | **dead** in current builds | The AC1 SDK published live wear here. **Current AC EVO writes `0.0` to all four slots all session** — verified across multiple sessions. **Tyre wear is confirmed NOT exposed via shared memory at any offset** — two independent A/B snapshot diffs (4 normal laps, then 5 laps with extreme L/R-asymmetric setup that should produce 5–10× wear differential between sides) both failed to surface any 4-wheel wear-shaped block in either physics (4 KB) or graphics (8 KB), at any plausible scale, including reserved padding inside each `SMEvoTyreState` and inside every still-opaque substruct. The HUD's "tyre wear N.NN" is computed by the game internally and never published. Keep the field in any port for AC1 compatibility but don't read from it. |
|    136 |   16 | `float[4]`  | `tyreDirtyLevel`       | 0..4 (approximate)        | Surface contamination from off-track grass/sand/marbles. |
|    152 |   16 | `float[4]`  | `tyreCoreTemperature`  | °C                       | Carcass core temperature. |
|    168 |   16 | `float[4]`  | `camberRAD`            | rad, **per-wheel local sign** | The setup-tool convention "negative = top-in" only matches shared-memory sign for **left-side wheels**. Right-side wheels report the **opposite sign**: a setup of −2.5° on FR/RR comes through as `+0.044` rad / `+0.035` rad here. Magnitude always matches the setup tool; sign is each wheel's outward-facing local frame. To translate to the uniform "negative = top-in" semantic, negate the right-side values. |
|    184 |   16 | `float[4]`  | `suspensionTravel`     | m                        | AC EVO no longer publishes a per-car max — calibrate by rolling-max. **Sign convention varies by car**: most cars report positive metres from full extension, but cars with active / electronically managed suspension report signed displacement from a static reference (rest near 0, compression negative). Take `abs()` before calibrating to handle both. |
|    200 |    4 | `float`     | `drs`                  | 0..1                     | DRS deploy state. |

|    208 |    4 | `float`     | `heading`              | rad                      | Yaw. |

|    220 |    4 | `float`     | `cgHeight`             | m                        | Centre-of-gravity height. |
|    224 |   20 | `float[5]`  | `carDamage`            | **NOT** 0..1 — absolute damage units | `[0]=front, [1]=rear, [2]=left, [3]=right, [4]=centre`. AC1 documented this as 0..1; in current AC EVO builds the values are **absolute**, magnitudes well above 1.0 — a verified front+centre crash produced `front=198.64`, `centre=237.11`, `rear=19.69`, `right=18.78`. Likely unit is impulsive energy (J) or plastic deformation (mm); not yet calibrated. UI consumers should clamp/normalise per their own threshold rather than treating the value as a fraction. |

|    740 |   16 | `float[4]`       | `padLife`             | **1 = fresh, decreasing → 0 = dead** | Same field, same name as the AC1 SDK. Numerically matches the in-game pad readout when scaled ×1000 (e.g. 0.029 → "29.00" in HUD). A 4-lap A/B test confirmed the AC1 "life remaining" semantic is still in effect: values **decreased** consistently across all four wheels (fronts shed twice as much as rears, matching the brake-force split). Note however that absolute values look surprisingly low for a "life remaining" interpretation (0.029 doesn't read like "2.9 % of fresh life left"); the absolute scale or unit is uncertain. Treat the value as a relative wear indicator, not as a calibrated remaining-fraction. |
|    756 |   16 | `float[4]`       | `discLife`            | **1 = fresh, decreasing → 0 = dead** | Same provenance and semantics as `padLife`. Front discs lose life roughly 2× faster than rears under typical brake balance. |

## 5. Graphics block — `Local\acevo_pmf_graphics`

Largest of the three blocks. The HUD-rate cadence makes it a poorer
choice than physics for closed-loop control, but it is the only source
for many fields: lap timing, position, fuel projection, electronics
state, and live engine output.

Listed in declaration order. Offsets are not included because the
embedded `char[33]` and `c_bool` fields induce alignment padding that
varies if Kunos re-orders or extends a substruct. Compute a current
offset table at runtime with
`ctypes.sizeof(_SPageFileGraphic) / .from_buffer_copy(...).field.offset`
or use the `dump` tool (§11).

```

See [§7.1](#71-tyre-state-256-b-per-corner) for the per-corner field
list. Note the wheel-name mapping vs the physics arrays:

### 5.12 Instrumentation & electronics (opaque substructs)

Each of these is a 128-byte block of car-dependent values. The overlay
maps them as opaque `byte[128]` so the surrounding offsets stay
correct; decoding will need a per-car schema (see §10).

## 6. Static block — `Local\acevo_pmf_static`

Written once when the session loads. AC EVO has **drastically slimmed
this block down vs AC1**: the car-spec fields (`maxRpm`, `maxPower`,
`maxTorque`, `maxTurboBoost`, `suspensionMaxTravel`, etc.) are gone
entirely. What remains is session and track metadata.

* **`max_rpm`** → `physics.currentMaxRpm` (per-tick) or
  `graphics.rpm_percent` (use the ratio directly).
* **`max_power`, `max_torque`** → `graphics.current_bhp`,
  `graphics.current_torque` give the *live* values; an absolute peak
  has to be observed (rolling max) or hard-coded per car.
* **`max_turbo_boost`** → `graphics.max_turbo_boost`.
* **`max_fuel`** → `graphics.max_fuel`.
* **`suspensionMaxTravel`** → calibrate per session by rolling-max on
  `physics.suspensionTravel`. The overlay seeds with `2× first sample`
  and tightens to `1.05× observed max` thereafter.

## 7. Embedded substructs

### 7.1 Tyre state (256 B per corner)

`SMEvoTyreState`, embedded four times in the graphics block.

| Type        | Field                                    | Units / Notes |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| `float`     | `slip`                                   | Combined slip. |
| `bool`      | `lock`                                   | Wheel locked **right now** (game-supplied — replaces the slip/angular-speed heuristic the AC1 plugin used). |
| `float`     | `tyre_pressure`                          | psi. |
| `float`     | `tyre_temperature_c`                     | °C, representative. |
| `float`     | `brake_temperature_c`                    | °C. |
| `float`     | `brake_pressure`                         | bar (per-corner). |
| `float`     | `tyre_temperature_left`                  | °C, left face of contact patch. |
| `float`     | `tyre_temperature_center`                | °C. |
| `float`     | `tyre_temperature_right`                 | °C, right face. |
| `char[33]`  | `tyre_compound_front`                    | Compound name, replicated in all four states. |
| `char[33]`  | `tyre_compound_rear`                     | |
| `float`     | `tyre_normalized_pressure`               | 1.0 = ideal cold pressure for current compound. **Not capped at 1.0** — under-inflated tyres read fractional values (e.g. 20-psi vs ideal-26 reads ~0.877), over-inflated tyres go above 1.0, with an observed **upper clamp at exactly 2.000** (a 35-psi setup hit the ceiling regardless of how much further over-pressure it was). |
| `float`     | `tyre_normalized_temperature_left`       | 1.0 = ideal. |
| `float`     | `tyre_normalized_temperature_center`     | 1.0 = ideal. |
| `float`     | `tyre_normalized_temperature_right`      | 1.0 = ideal. |
| `float`     | `brake_normalized_temperature`           | 1.0 = ideal. |
| `float`     | `tyre_normalized_temperature_core`       | 1.0 = ideal. |
| —           | _reserved padding to 256 B_              | Reserved for future extension. |

The "left/right" axis is the **contact-patch face viewed from outside
the car**: a left-side wheel has `left = outer face, right = inner
face`; right-side wheels are mirrored. The overlay normalises this via
the `is_left = wid[1] == "L"` check.

The in-game HUD's "OMI" line (three temperature numbers per tyre,
e.g. `60.00 / 60.00 / 60.00` parked, diverging into a per-face
gradient under cornering load) **is `tyre_temperature_left / _center
/ _right` in raw °C**. Verified by a 4-lap A/B test on a
left-turn-biased track: parked baseline read uniform 60 / 60 / 60
across all four tyres, post-laps read showed exactly the asymmetric
heat distribution the physics demands — left-side tyres warmed
~5–10 °C with a rising L→R gradient (inner-face hottest under
cornering camber load), right-side tyres equilibrated below 60 °C
with a falling L→R gradient. Both magnitude and per-face gradient
direction match what the in-game HUD displayed.

### 7.2 Damage state (128 B) — opaque

`SMEvoDamageState` in `graphics.car_damage`. The five-zone summary in
`physics.carDamage[5]` (front / rear / left / right / centre, 0..1) is
the most usable view today. The 128-byte block likely carries
per-component damage (suspension corners, panels, aero, mechanicals);
exact field list is still TBD — see §10.

### 7.3 Pit info (64 B) — opaque

`SMEvoPitInfo` in `graphics.pit_info`. Likely contains: pit-stop state
machine (idle / requested / in-progress / serving / done), tyres /
fuel / repair flags, time remaining. Exact layout TBD.

### 7.4 Electronics & instrumentation (128 B each) — opaque

Three parallel 128-byte blocks per category:

* `electronics` / `instrumentation` — current values
* `*_min_limit` / `*_max_limit` — per-channel min and max
* `electronics_is_modifiable` — per-channel writability

The channel definition is car-dependent (engine map, brake migration,
ABS index, TC index, diff entry/mid/exit, etc.). Decoding will require
a per-car calibration map; see §10 for an investigation strategy.

### 7.5 Session state (256 B) — opaque

`SMEvoSessionState` in `graphics.session_state`. Likely carries the
detail behind the headline `session` enum: time remaining, sectors,
session phase, weather summary. Layout TBD.

### 7.6 Timing state (256 B) — opaque

`SMEvoTimingState` in `graphics.timing_state`. Likely carries lap
sector splits, optimal/theoretical lap, personal best splits, gap to
leader. Layout TBD.

### 7.7 Assists state (64 B) — opaque

`SMEvoAssistsState` in `graphics.assists_state`. Likely carries the
on/off + level for every driver aid (auto-clutch, auto-shift, ideal
line, fuel-rate, tyre-rate, etc.). Layout TBD.

---

## 8. Enumerations

Names below are sourced from the Steam guide #3707421508 and from the
overlay's own field comments. **Numeric values are not all confirmed**
from a public source — fill them in as they're verified against a
running game. Where the overlay relies on a specific value
(`pitLimiterOn != 0`, etc.), it does so by truthiness, not by named
constant — so missing numerics here don't block the overlay, they just
make this doc less useful as a study reference.

### 8.1 `ACEVO_STATUS` (`graphics.status`)

Game-loop state: typically `OFF`, `REPLAY`, `LIVE`, `PAUSE`. Numeric
values TBC.

### 8.2 `ACEVO_CAR_LOCATION` (`graphics.car_location`)

Where the player car is on the track:

* track / pit lane / pit box / on grid / approaching pit / leaving pit

Numeric values TBC.

### 8.3 `ACEVO_FLAG_TYPE` (`graphics.flag`, `graphics.global_flag`)

Marshal flags shown to the driver:

* none / blue / yellow / black / white / checkered / penalty / orange
  (mechanical) / FCY / SC / VSC

Numeric values TBC. `flag` is the flag shown specifically to the
focused car; `global_flag` is the session-wide flag.

### 8.4 `ACEVO_ENGINE_TYPE` (`graphics.engine_type`)

Powertrain category:

* internal-combustion / hybrid / electric / formula-style hybrid

Numeric values TBC. The overlay uses `engine_type` only via
`has_kers` — the bool form is enough for the chip strip.

### 8.5 `ACEVO_SESSION_TYPE` (`static.session`)

* practice / qualifying / race / hotlap / time-attack / drift /
  drag

Numeric values TBC.

### 8.6 `ACEVO_STARTING_GRIP`

* low / optimum / greenline / fast / damp / wet / flooded

Numeric values TBC.

### 8.7 `ERS_HEAT_CHARGING` (`physics.ersHeatCharging`)

* off / from kinetic only / from heat (MGUH)

Numeric values TBC.

### 8.8 `BRAKE_COMPOUND` (`physics.frontBrakeCompound`, `physics.rearBrakeCompound`)

* per-game pad+disc compound id

Numeric values TBC. Names (carbon road / carbon race / iron / etc.)
are car-dependent.

### 8.9 `P2P_STATUS` (`physics.P2PStatus`)

* idle / armed / active / cooling-down

Numeric values TBC.

## 9. Semantic gotchas vs Assetto Corsa 1

These are the traps that most reliably cause AC1-era code to misbehave
when re-pointed at AC EVO.

### 9.1 `tyreWear` is dead in AC EVO (and the live wear is unreachable)

AC1 published live tyre wear as `tyreWear ∈ [0, 100]` (percent
remaining, 100 = fresh). The Steam-guide-documented AC EVO version of
the same field uses an inverted `[0, 1]` "fraction worn" scale (0 =
new, 1 = fully worn) — but **it is never populated**: across multiple
sessions the field reads `(0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0)` from the moment the
mapping appears until session end, regardless of how long you drive.
The overlay used to compute `tire_w = 1 - tyreWear` from this field;
that's now a constant 1.0 (i.e. "fresh") and the wear bar is a
permanent placeholder until/unless Kunos populates the field.

**Three independent investigations** (in order of definitiveness):

1. *4 normal laps, A/B diff:* no wear-shaped 4-wheel block changed.
2. *5 laps with extreme L/R-asymmetric setup* (left tyres 20 psi /
   −4° camber, right tyres 35 psi / −2.5° camber): no asymmetric
   wear-shaped block.
3. *5 laps with diagonal pressure asymmetry + dual compound*
   (front road tyres, rear hyper tyres) **plus an explicit
   value-targeted scan** using HUD readouts `[FL=7.97, FR=7.99,
   RL=6.98, RR=6.98]`: no aligned float anywhere in physics (4 KB)
   or graphics (8 KB) holds any of those values at any scale (×1,
   ×0.1, ×0.01, ×0.001), as a double, as an integer, contiguous, or
   TyreState-strided. A wider sanity scan looking for *any* aligned
   float anywhere in either block whose value falls in `[6.5, 8.5]`
   returned **zero hits** — confirming there's nothing in the
   right magnitude range to even be a candidate.

Every other HUD value (pressure, temperature, pad/disc life,
brake pressure, etc.) is locatable via the same value-targeted
search. Only tyre wear cannot. **The HUD's tyre-wear figure is
computed by the game internally and never written to shared memory.**

### 9.2 The static block is no longer car-focused

AC1's static block carried the car spec sheet (`maxRpm`, `maxPower`,
`maxTorque`, `maxTurboBoost`, `suspensionMaxTravel`). Those are all
gone in AC EVO. The replacements are listed in §6; the most surprising
one is that there's **no static `maxRpm`** — the canonical
replacement is the per-tick `physics.currentMaxRpm`, which can vary
during a session.

### 9.3 Ride-height units are not consistent across cars

`physics.rideHeight` is metres on most cars, but some chassis (notably
older mods) publish millimetres directly. Auto-detect by magnitude:
any `|h| ≥ 1.0` is implausibly tall in metres, so treat it as mm.

### 9.3a Suspension travel sign convention is not consistent across cars

`physics.suspensionTravel` is positive metres from full extension on
most cars, but cars with active or electronically managed suspension
publish a signed displacement from a static reference instead — values
cluster around `-0.03` at rest and swing a couple of cm on kerbs.
Without `abs()`, an unsigned-only consumer never sees a positive
sample, never seeds its rolling-max calibration, and the corresponding
UI element stays pinned to whatever default it picks for "uncalibrated"
(in this overlay, dead-centre 0.5). Take the magnitude before
calibrating; both conventions then render identically.

### 9.4 `accG` ordering is `[lat, vert, long]`

AC1's `accG` was `[long, lat, vert]` in some references and `[lat,
vert, long]` in others — AC EVO's documented ordering is `[0]=lat,
[1]=vert, [2]=long`, which **matches** the graphics block's
`g_forces_x/y/z` ordering. Don't assume forward-axis-first.

### 9.5 `tc` / `abs` (physics) ≠ `tc_active` / `abs_active` / `tcInAction` / `absInAction`

* `physics.tc`, `physics.abs` (float, 0..1) — driver-set aid
  **strength** (i.e. "what level is the TC dial on"). Non-zero even
  when no power cut is happening.
* `physics.tcInAction`, `physics.absInAction` (int, 0/1) — the system
  is **right now actively cutting / modulating**. This is the precise
  signal for a "currently engaging" UI chip.
* `graphics.tc_active`, `graphics.abs_active` (bool) — a HUD-rate
  approximation; lags the physics-rate `*InAction` by up to one
  display frame.

The overlay's chip-blink uses `*InAction` for accuracy.

### 9.6 The wheel name mapping in graphics differs from physics

* Physics arrays: `[FL, FR, RL, RR]` (uniform)
* Graphics fields: `tyre_lf`, `tyre_rf`, `tyre_lr`, `tyre_rr` —
  `lf/rf/lr/rr`, **not** `fl/fr/rl/rr`.

Same wheels, just a different naming convention. Map at the boundary.

### 9.7 Compound name is replicated

`tyre_compound_front` and `tyre_compound_rear` are duplicated across
all four `SMEvoTyreState` instances. Read once (e.g. from
`tyre_lf`) — they don't differ between the four.

### 9.7a `camberRAD` sign is per-wheel local, not uniform

The setup-tool convention "negative camber = top tilted toward the
car" only matches the shared-memory sign for **left-side wheels**.
Right-side wheels report the **opposite sign**: a setup of −2.5° on
FR/RR comes through `physics.camberRAD` as `+0.044` rad / `+0.035`
rad. Magnitude always matches the setup tool exactly; the sign is
each wheel's outward-facing local frame. To recover a uniform
"negative = top-in" semantic, negate the right-side values
(`camberRAD[1]`, `camberRAD[3]`). The overlay's camber-strip widget
happens to render correctly *because* the sign is per-wheel local —
each wheel's strip leans in the direction the top of that wheel is
actually tilted. Consumers comparing camber across sides (e.g. a
single uniform "max camber" warning) need to apply the negation.

### 9.7b `physics.carDamage[5]` is not 0..1

AC1 documented `carDamage[5]` as 0..1 per zone. AC EVO writes
**absolute** damage values into the same slot, with magnitudes well
above 1.0 — a verified front+centre crash produced `front=198.64`,
`centre=237.11`, `rear=19.69`, `right=18.78`. Likely unit is impulse
energy (J) or plastic deformation (mm), not yet calibrated. UI
consumers must clamp/normalise per their own threshold; treating the
value as a fraction will saturate any visual gauge instantly.

### 9.8 `c_bool` is one byte, `int32` flags are four

AC EVO mixes the two. The graphics block uses `c_bool` heavily, while
physics uses `int32` flags. ctypes handles this natively but it
changes the alignment math: a sequence of three `bool`s consumes 3
bytes, then an `int32` after them needs 1 byte of padding for
alignment.

---

## 10. Still-opaque areas worth investigating

Each of these is mapped as a `byte[N]` blob today — no field-level
decoding. Listed by priority (highest-value first):

1. **`graphics.session_state` (256 B)** — almost certainly carries
   session time/laps remaining, sector boundaries, weather phase.
   Comparing dumps across session-type changes (practice → qual →
   race) will quickly spot the type-discriminator field.
1a. **Tyre wear: confirmed NOT in shared memory** (closed
   investigation). The in-game HUD shows a "tyre wear N.NN %" line
   per tyre, but **two independent A/B snapshot diffs failed to find
   any wear-shaped 4-wheel block** anywhere in physics or graphics —
   first across 4 normal laps, then across 5 laps with deliberately
   wear-asymmetric setup (left tyres 20 psi / −4° camber, right tyres
   35 psi / −2.5° camber, which should produce 5–10× different wear
   per side). Neither test surfaced a candidate at any 4-byte aligned
   offset, at any plausible scale, in any reserved padding, or in any
   opaque substruct. The HUD value is computed by the game and never
   published via SHM. **Tyre wear cannot be retrieved.** Consumers
   that need a wear indicator must either repurpose `padLife` /
   `discLife` (see §4.2 — moves slowly, axle-symmetric) or synthesise
   one from `slipRatio × wheelLoad × dt` integrated per wheel.

   Companion finding: the HUD's "OMI" line *is* in shared memory —
   it's `tyre_temperature_left/center/right` in raw °C. Verified
   against live HUD with matching gradients across asymmetric driving
   (see §7.1).

2. **`graphics.timing_state` (256 B)** — sector splits, theoretical
   best, gap-to-leader. Triggering a lap completion and capturing
   before/after dumps will surface the split-time fields.
3. **`graphics.car_damage` (128 B)** — likely a per-component
   breakdown deeper than the 5-zone `physics.carDamage[5]` summary.
   Drive into a wall on each axle in turn and diff to find the
   per-component slots.
4. **`graphics.electronics` + min/max/is_modifiable** — driver maps
   for engine, brake migration, diff, etc. Cycle each map up & down
   in-game, capture before/after dumps. The `*_is_modifiable` block
   should narrow the candidates.
5. **`graphics.assists_state` (64 B)** — driver-aid on/off + levels.
   Toggle aids one at a time and diff.
6. **`graphics.pit_info` (64 B)** — pit-stop state machine. Trigger a
   pit stop and dump in each phase.
7. **`graphics.instrumentation` + min/max** — car-dependent gauge
   feed. Will require per-car calibration.
8. **Numeric values for all enums in §8.** Run the dump tool with
   `--watch` while changing the relevant in-game state (e.g. cycle
   sessions) and read the int directly.

The dump tool's `--scan LO HI` and `--track-monotonic DURATION LO HI`
modes are tailored to this kind of investigation — see §11.

---

## 11. Inspecting & extending the layout

The overlay ships a dump tool that attaches to the live shared memory
and exposes three modes for layout investigation:

```bash
# Parsed view of every field the overlay knows about, refreshing every 1 s.
python -m live_telemetry_evo.sources.dump physics  --parsed --watch 1.0
python -m live_telemetry_evo.sources.dump graphics --parsed --watch 1.0
python -m live_telemetry_evo.sources.dump static   --parsed

# Raw hex window — first 256 bytes.
python -m live_telemetry_evo.sources.dump physics --bytes 256

# List every aligned float in [LO, HI].
# Pick a range tight enough to rule out padding (e.g. tyre wear lives
# in [0, 1], brake disc temp in [50, 900]). Run twice with different
# real-world states; offsets that changed are candidates.
python -m live_telemetry_evo.sources.dump physics --scan 0.5 1.0

# Sample over DURATION_S; report aligned floats that only ever
# decreased and stayed in [LO, HI]. True wear / monotonic counters
# pop out cleanly.
python -m live_telemetry_evo.sources.dump physics --track-monotonic 60 0.5 1.0
```

Recommended workflow when extending the layout for a new field:

1. Find the byte range with `--scan` (or `--track-monotonic` for
   wear-like fields), narrowing by drive-state correlation.
2. Confirm with a second `--scan` after you've changed the real-world
   value — only the matching offset should track.
3. Add the field to the corresponding ctypes struct in
   [`src/live_telemetry_evo/sources/ac_evo.py`](../src/live_telemetry_evo/sources/ac_evo.py).
   Keep `_pack_ = 4` and put the field at the documented offset; if
   inserting mid-struct, the size of the surrounding fields must stay
   correct or every offset after it shifts.
4. Add a row to this document with the offset, type, units and
   semantic notes.
5. Add a parsed line to `dump.py`'s `_print_parsed` so future
   investigators can see the value without re-instrumenting.

Tips for safe iteration:

* Map a generously-sized region (the overlay maps 4 kB / 8 kB / 2 kB).
  Mapping bigger than written is harmless; mapping smaller truncates
  trailing fields.
* Always range-clamp newly added fields in the
  `_apply_physics` / `_apply_graphics` paths. If your offset is wrong,
  the value will be visibly out of range rather than silently
  poisoning a downstream consumer.
* When in doubt, log `ctypes.sizeof(_SPageFile…)` at startup — a size
  drift vs the documented `800 / N / 210` is the fastest signal that
  a field is mis-sized.
